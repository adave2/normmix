# normmix
R functions for mixtures of two normal distribution.
To work with mixtures of two normal distributions in R, you can use the functions dnormMix, pnormMix, qnormMix, and rnormMix which are typically found within the EnvStats package; these functions allow you to calculate the density, cumulative distribution function, quantile function, and generate random samples from a mixture of two normal distributions, respectively.
